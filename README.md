# Pneumonia-daiagnosis 
We used Densenet 121 and 201 as well as Inception v3 for our model
the purpose was to create a robust machine learning algorithm for diagnostic purposes
We used ensembling learning for the combination of all the individual CNN models
The code was written in obects forms and so was we used classes for the various components
